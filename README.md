# Intro to Aruba Networking Overview Guide

**Description/Overview:** Aruba offers an integrated suite of computer networking solutions, such as ClearPass, AirWave, Aruba Central, and Mobility Conductor. Of these four, *ClearPass* is a technology for network policy management and secure access control, *AirWave* is a tool for on-site monitoring and network infrastructure management (both wired and wireless), *Aruba Central* provides a cloud-based alternative to AirWave's functionalities, and *Mobility Conductor* offers a centralized controller for managing access points and Mobility Controller clusters for high-traffic wireless networks.

| What It Is | A technology for network policy management and enforcement. | A tool for on-site monitoring and network infrastructure management (both wired and wireless). | A cloud-based alternative to AirWave. | A centralized controller. |
| What It Does | Provides secure network access control for devices and users, including authentication, authorization, and user activity tracking. | Device monitoring and managing (for both Aruba products and other vendors). | Provides on-premises monitoring and wired and wireless network infrastructure management. | Reliably manages up to many (e.g., thousands) access points and Mobility Controller clusters for high-traffic wireless networks in a hierarchical and centralized manner (and with high scalability potential). |
| Integration | Integrates with 140+ partnered IT security solutions. | Integrates with ClearPass for granular-level (e.g., interfaces, apps, users ) network monitoring. | Integrates with many security monitoring and service monitoring platforms. | Supports Wi-Fi 7, WPA3, and other contemporary security standards. |
